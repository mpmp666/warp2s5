"""Protocol racing + loss measurement - official-client racing meets yxip-style scoring.

Two ideas combined:

* **racing** (from the official client's log):
  ``connect_with_protocol_racing{primary="masque" secondary="H2"}`` with
  ``secondary_delay=Some(1s)`` - MASQUE(QUIC) starts immediately, H2(TCP) starts
  a second later, and whichever proves it can carry traffic first wins.
* **loss scoring** (from warp-endpoint-optimizer / warp-yxip): a single probe
  says almost nothing on a lossy path, so the winner is measured with several
  probes and scored by *(loss rate, latency)* - the same ordering as its
  ``result.csv`` (``sort -k2 -k3``, loss first then latency).

A transport only qualifies once a real DNS query sent *through* it comes back;
a finished handshake plus ``:status 200`` proves nothing on a filtered network.
